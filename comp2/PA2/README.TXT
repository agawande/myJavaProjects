PROJECT TITLE:  Netflix Filter
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To read a datafile containing info about media and 
                    allow the user to search through it with the help of
                    filters.

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Run the client program and consult the menu.                                                            

AUTHORS: Ashlesh Gawande

USER INSTRUCTIONS: Read the menu carefully. 
                   I)First thing the program asks is what you wanna do:
                   Add filter, remove, clear all filters or print them.
                   
                   II)Then it asks about the field: movie, year or rating. 
                   
                   III)The new movies, for example: Margret Thratcher, 
                   haven't got a rating yet and hence been assigned zero 
                   rating. 
                   
                   IV)Please search for such a movie directly by entering 4 or
                     5 on the field option. 
                     where 4 = exact title, for example: "Iron Man 2" returns exactly one match
                     and 5 = title contains, for example: "Dil" returns 8 results.
                   
                   PS: Both 4 and 5 are Case and Space sensitive. 
                   
                   PPS: I assigned a zero value when there is no year or no star. 
                        You might have to search for something if you want to make sure 
                        its definitely not in their.  
                   
                   I hope you enjoy using my version of the filter.
                   Thank you.
